2. Click Manage Keys and create a key and download the resulting `project-name.json`
3. Json stringify the json contained in `project-name.json` by using this tool [JSON Stringify Online](https://jsonformatter.org/json-stringify-online)
4. Set the environment variable:
    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=<<YOUR_GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON>>
    ```

**Local only**
1. Follow the [Google API Quickstart Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/python).
2. Set up your environment and a Google Cloud project.
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen.
4. Move the downloaded `credentials.json` file to your workflow directory.
5. On the first run, the server will prompt you to log in with your Google credentials, generating the `token.json` file.
